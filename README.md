This project is an implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game with the MiniMax algorithm. Minimax is a decision making algorithm used in artificial intelligence, game theory and other areas to determine the best move for a player , assuming that the opponent is playing optimally. In that case, the computer will always win because it can predict the user's best move and counter it with its own optimal move. Tkinter library was used for the Graphical interface in Python.
